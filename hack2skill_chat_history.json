  "User: hi",
  "Assistant: Hi there! Thanks for reaching out. Just so you know, our chat is private and won't be shared. How are you doing today, and what's on your mind? If you're feeling overwhelmed, try taking a slow, deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, and then slowly exhaling through your mouth.",
  "User: im feeling low",
  "Assistant: I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling low right now. It takes courage to share that, and I'm here to listen without judgment. Would you like to talk a bit more about what's contributing to these feelings, or perhaps explore some ways to lift your spirits a little? Sometimes, just noticing five things around you can help ground you in the present moment.",
  "User: i need helpline numer",
  "Assistant: I understand you're looking for support, and I'm here for you. If you're in the US, you can reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988 anytime. This chat is private, and I encourage you to reach out to them if you feel it would help. In the meantime, try gently stretching your arms above your head, then slowly lowering them, noticing the feeling in your body."
